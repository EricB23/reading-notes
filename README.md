My reading notes for course 102
*"Growth mindset"*  is being able to believe in your abilities and fight through struggles, even if you fail time and time again. To have a *"Growth mindset"* is to have the ability to learn consistently and constantly, there is no losing only learning.

## A few reminders I keep to help to stay in a *"Growth Mindset"*\

- *Every failure is not a lost cause, but a new opportunity*
- *"You miss 100% of the shots you don't take."* - **Wayne Gretsky**
- *"Rebellions are built on hope"* - **Cassian Andor**

### My name is Eric Baxter and it's an honor to learn and grow and work with all of you
