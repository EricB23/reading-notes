# Reading Notes Class 10

## Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error

Syntax errors are when there are spelling errors in your code that cause the program to not run, or stop part way through. These usually are okay to fix as long as you know what the error message means.

Logic errors are when the syntax is correct but the code is not what the user intended it to be, meaning the program runs successfully but gives incorrect results.

## List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them

I remember getting a couple of syntax errors when i was running the function to produce results with a random number generator but I hadn't appended the right element in my code somewheere, and then I had a declaration that wasn't being read because it was inside of a whole different function.

## How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

It teaches me to be aware of what kind of mistakes that's possible to make in writing and reading my code.

## How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

The debugger allows you to watch the flow of your code and if you want to put pauses in certain places in your code to see what is preventing it from running properly.

## Define what a breakpoint is

A breakpoint is when you place a pause in your code to allow you to identify what problems may occur to prevent you from running your code properly.

## What is the call stack?

The call stack is a section that shows you what code was executed to get to the current line.
