## What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?

It allows the developer to work out of two settings. 2-d and 3-d. Both of these settings come with their own seperate properties.

## Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.

The 'pop' effect makes images and words stand out on a webpage. I could use that effect to make an image be the main attraction on a website if I was having a sale.

## What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?

It allows the developer to enhance the UX by giving visuals, and support what the effect of the transition entails.

## How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?

Animation allows you to change the properties over a certain amount of time. But transitions can define how an element changes over a certain amount of time.

## What are some benefits to using CSS transitions on websites?

They're easy to use, you don't have to have any knowledge of JS to create them. The animations are all smooth and perform even with a poor system load.

## How this topic fit in with your long-term goals?

This will allow to create new projects that catch the eye of the viewer and stand out more.
