# Class-08 Reading Notes

## What is an expression in JavaScript?

An expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of expressions: those that have side effects and those that are purely evaluate.

## Why would we use a loop in our code?

Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing.

## When does a for loop stop executing?

When the specified condition evaluates to false during the loop.

## How many times will a while loop execute?

The statement will execute as long as the specified condition will equate to being true.

### Primary Expression

23;
'Hello World';
true;
sum;
this;

### Logical expression

10 > 9 = true

10 < 20 = true
